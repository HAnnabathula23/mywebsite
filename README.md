I created this website to share my passions, goals, and journey with others. It’s a space where I can document my progress, reflect on my experiences, and showcase the work I’m dedicated to, especially in the fields of science, medicine, and community service. By sharing my story, I hope to inspire others and connect with like-minded individuals who share similar values and aspirations. This platform also serves as a way for me to stay focused and motivated as I work toward my ultimate goal of becoming a doctor.
